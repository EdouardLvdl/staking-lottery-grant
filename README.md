## Motivation and Goals

This project will build a Dapp for a risk free staking lottery on ICON. For more information on our staking lottery project, you can refer to this Medium post: [Introducing the ICON ($ICX) Risk-free Lottery](https://medium.com/stakin/introducing-the-icon-icx-risk-free-lottery-44d6ffa5c37a)

There are numerous gaming Dapp on blockchains, but few have managed to successfully integrate with the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape. Staking on ICON offer very attractive yield, which represents a massive opportunity to attract more crypto-enthusiasts to the protocol.

Built on the model of Pool Together, we are building the first staking lottery Dapp and we are building it on ICON. Now, anybody can reinvest its I-score into lottery tickets, and get the chance to win a whole pool of ICX.

With the staking lottery, ICX token holders will benefit from a new option to stake their assets. ICON might gain some press additional press coverage, and non-ICX investors may even buy some ICXs in order to take part in the game. Our hope is that this will encourage more community involvement and a valuable marketing tool for the ICON blockchain.
